### About Me
Computer Science graduate (2024) from Luxor University and a graduate of the 9-Month AI & ML Professional Diploma at the Information Technology Institute (ITI). Junior AI Engineer with a strong foundation in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, Computer Vision, and Generative AI.

Experienced in building end-to-end AI-powered systems, including RAG pipelines, multi-agent architectures, recommendation systems, and computer vision models. Skilled in Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, FastAPI, Flask, Docker, AWS, and Linux.

In addition to AI, I have solid backend development experience using PHP and Python, with hands-on practice in RESTful APIs, database design (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB), and deploying applications to servers.

Passionate about open-source technologies and Linux ecosystems, and continuously improving my engineering skills beyond AI to become a software engineer capable of building complete real-world products and scalable solutions end-to-end.

Outside of my studies, I enjoy reading books. I love learning languages and experience different cultures and Gaming. I believe in continuous self-improvement and no limit to love learning new things.
